# Urbanist accounts on Mastodon

This repository provides a most simple webapp that helps to bulk follow accounts related to cities, transport and urban planning on the FOSS microbloging service Mastodon. In it you can create a csv-file that can be uploaded in your mastodon settings, in order to follow every account from the list.

The repository is forked from a list of sociologists (https://www.perspektivbrocken.org/en/2022/10/28/sociologists-on-mastodon-a-list/).
